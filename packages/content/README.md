# @vite-hub/content

ViteHub content integration for Comark Content.

Pass ViteHub Source definitions, registered names, readers, reader factories, or native Comark raw Sources. A single source becomes a named `default` instance. Named sources are composed with Comark's `contentHub()`, with ViteHub adapters for named cache operations and positional search arguments.

```ts
import { defineContent } from "@vite-hub/content"
import fs from "comark-content/sources/fs"

export const content = defineContent({
  sources: {
    docs: fs("./docs"),
    blog: fs("./blog"),
  },
})
```

Use `contentSource(input, { prefix, schema })` to configure a Source. Adapted Sources retain one reader per asynchronous load, including overlapping refreshes. `defineContentHandler()` adapts the Comark Web handler to H3 events.
