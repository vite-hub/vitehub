# @vite-hub/content

ViteHub content integration for Comark Content.

Pass ViteHub Source definitions, registered names, readers, reader factories, or native Comark raw Sources. A single source becomes a named `default` instance. Named sources are composed with Comark's `contentHub()`, with ViteHub adapters for named cache operations and positional search arguments.

```ts
import { defineContent } from "@vite-hub/content"
import fs from "comark-content/sources/fs"

export const content = defineContent({
  sources: {
    docs: fs("./docs"),
    blog: fs("./blog"),
  },
})
```

`defineContent()` forwards Comark plugins to each content instance. Install the
plugin you need and pass it in `plugins`; plugin options are evaluated when the
content runtime is created and can be changed by rebuilding or recreating that
runtime.

```ts
import knap from "comark-knap"

export const content = defineContent({
  plugins: [
    knap({
      variables: {
        environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
      },
    }),
  ],
  source: fs("./docs"),
})
```

Use per-render Markdown APIs when plugin values must come from an individual
request or invocation. Content parsing and cache refreshes use the plugin list
configured on the content runtime.

Use `contentSource(input, { prefix, schema })` to configure a Source. Adapted Sources retain one reader per asynchronous load, including overlapping refreshes. `defineContentHandler()` adapts the Comark Web handler to H3 events.
