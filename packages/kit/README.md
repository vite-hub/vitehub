# @vite-hub/kit

Headless parts for Vue and Nuxt: dialogs, menus, tabs, selects, date pickers, toasts, and more. The parts have behavior, focus, keyboard, and ARIA, and no styles. You style them through their `data-slot` attributes.

The behavior comes from [ui-sdk](https://ui-sdk.dev). Each entry of this package re-exports the matching entry of `@ui-sdk/vue` unchanged, with the same names, props, and types. The package installs only `@ui-sdk/vue` and `@ui-sdk/core`, so it does not bring the editor, terminal, or highlighter dependencies of `@vite-hub/ui`.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @vite-hub/kit vue
```

## Import paths

Import each part from its own entry, so an app loads only the parts it uses. There is no root entry.

| Import | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `@vite-hub/kit/<name>` | The parts and helpers of `@ui-sdk/vue/<name>`, for example `@vite-hub/kit/dialog`, `@vite-hub/kit/tabs`, and `@vite-hub/kit/date-picker`. Every entry of `@ui-sdk/vue` has one. |
| `@vite-hub/kit/nuxt` | The Nuxt module |

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Tabs, TabsList, TabsPanel, TabsTab } from "@vite-hub/kit/tabs";
</script>

<template>
  <Tabs default-value="code">
    <TabsList>
      <TabsTab value="code">Code</TabsTab>
      <TabsTab value="preview">Preview</TabsTab>
    </TabsList>
    <TabsPanel value="code">...</TabsPanel>
    <TabsPanel value="preview">...</TabsPanel>
  </Tabs>
</template>
```

For the props and parts of each component, read the [ui-sdk docs](https://ui-sdk.dev).

## Nuxt

The module auto-imports every part as a component and every helper, such as `createDialogController()` and `formatNumber()`. Set `prefix` when the app has its own components with the same names:

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Registers <UiDialog>, <UiTabsTab>, and so on. Without a prefix, the names are <Dialog> and <TabsTab>.
  modules: [["@vite-hub/kit/nuxt", { prefix: "Ui" }]],
});
```

The `viteHubKit` key of `nuxt.config.ts` takes the same options.

The module installs the ui-sdk Nuxt module and points its imports at `@vite-hub/kit/<name>`. With pnpm, the app cannot resolve `@ui-sdk/vue` itself, so without this the generated types of the parts would be `any`.
